# Traffic-Management
Inspiration: In India, an Ambulance called may take a lot of time to arrive, which may be fatal. SO we wanted to build upon an idea which may potentially reduce ambulance arrival times by managing traffic in an effective way.


What it does:

How we built it:
	We will install GPS tracker on Ambulance and connect to google cloud. The current location will be shared to the main server which will predict the time required to reach the signal. It will then see the status of the signal at the stipulated time and will change or extend the signal accordingly.

Technologies used: 
	GPS on Ambulance, Traffic detection near signals, Current state of Traffic signal, predicted state on signal when ambulances reaches the square, green light is  extended or red light changes to green giving priority to medical emergency

Challenges we ran into: 
	
	
What we learned:

whats next:






Tasks :
Include Google Maps. Add destination(option). 
Host a website. 
Detect intersections. 
Detect current status of signal
Predict signal status when ambulance reaches
Frontend - React, HTML, CSS to create a user-friendly UI
PostgreSQL to build a database
Heroku to deploy the API
GoogleMap API to display a map of the current location
Backend -  Node.js to add functionality to the web app.
